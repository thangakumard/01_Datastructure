/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops
 * There are n cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array flights where flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei] indicates that there is a flight from city fromi to city toi with cost pricei.
 *
 * You are also given three integers src, dst, and k, return the cheapest price from src to dst with at most k stops. If there is no such route, return -1.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: n = 4, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]], src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1
 * Output: 700
 * Explanation:
 * The graph is shown above.
 * The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 3 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 600 = 700.
 * Note that the path through cities [0,1,2,3] is cheaper but is invalid because it uses 2 stops.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
 * Output: 200
 * Explanation:
 * The graph is shown above.
 * The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 100 = 200.
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
 * Output: 500
 * Explanation:
 * The graph is shown above.
 * The optimal path with no stops from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 500.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= n <= 100
 * 0 <= flights.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)
 * flights[i].length == 3
 * 0 <= fromi, toi < n
 * fromi != toi
 * 1 <= pricei <= 104
 * There will not be any multiple flights between two cities.
 * 0 <= src, dst, k < n
 * src != dst
