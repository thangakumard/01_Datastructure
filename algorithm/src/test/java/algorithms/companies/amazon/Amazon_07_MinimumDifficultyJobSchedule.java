 * https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difficulty-of-a-job-schedule/
 * You want to schedule a list of jobs in d days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the ith job, you have to finish all the jobs j where 0 <= j < i).
You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the d days. The difficulty
 of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done on that day.
You are given an integer array jobDifficulty and an integer d. The difficulty of the ith job is jobDifficulty[i].
Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return -1.



Example 1:
Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.
Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.
The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7

* Example 2:
Input: jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: If you finish a job per day you will still have a free day. you cannot find a schedule for the given jobs.

* Example 3:
Input: jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The schedule is one job per day. total difficulty will be 3.


Constraints:

1 <= jobDifficulty.length <= 300
0 <= jobDifficulty[i] <= 1000
1 <= d <= 10
