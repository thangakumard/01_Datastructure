 * Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
 *
 * Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
 * Output: 10
 *
 * Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
 * Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 105
 * nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
 * 0 <= k <= nums.length
