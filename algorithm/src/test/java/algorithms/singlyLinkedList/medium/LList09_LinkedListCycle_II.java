/*****
 * 
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/ Given a linked list,
 * return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.
 * 
 * There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can
 * be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos
 * is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected
 * to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
 * 
 * Notice that you should not modify the linked list.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1 Output: tail connects to node index 1
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the
 * second node. Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0 Output: tail connects to node index 0
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the
 * first node. Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: head = [1], pos = -1 Output: no cycle Explanation: There is no cycle
 * in the linked list.
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104]. -105 <=
 * Node.val <= 105 pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.
