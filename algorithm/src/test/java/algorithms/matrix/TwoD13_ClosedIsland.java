/******
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-closed-islands/
 * Given a 2D grid consists of 0s (land) and 1s (water).  An island is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of 0s and a closed island is an island totally (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by 1s.

	Return the number of closed islands.

	Example 1:
	Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]]
	Output: 2
	Explanation: 
	Islands in gray are closed because they are completely surrounded by water (group of 1s).
	
	Example 2:
	Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,1,0]]
	Output: 1
	Example 3:
	
	Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
	               [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
	               [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
	               [1,0,1,0,1,0,1],
	               [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
	               [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
	               [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]]
	Output: 2
	 
	Constraints:
	
	1 <= grid.length, grid[0].length <= 100
	0 <= grid[i][j] <=1
