/**
 * Given a matrix cost[][] and a position(M,N) in cost[][],
 * write a function that returns cost of minimum cost path to reach (M,N) from (0,0).
 * Each cell of the matrix represents a cost to traverse through that cell.
 * The total cost of a path to reach (M,N) is the sum of all the costs on that path (including both source and destination).
 * You can only traverse down, right and diagonally lower cells from a given cell, i,e,
 * from a given cell (i,j) cells(i+1,j),(i,j+1)and (i+1,j+1) can be traversed.
